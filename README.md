## 🛡 Vision
**Fortress-2025** is a hardware-centric smartphone architecture designed to render high-level state-sponsored surveillance (such as Pegasus and its successors) technically and economically unfeasible. By relocating the "Root of Trust" from the software kernel to an **Isolated Quantum Enclave (IQE)**, the system binds data access to the user's real-time biological and spatial presence.

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### 1. Continuous Bio-Authentication (Liveness Detection)
Unlike static biometrics (FaceID/Fingerprint), Fortress-2025 utilizes a sub-dermal or high-fidelity dermal sensor acting as a **Hardware Data Diode**.
* **Metrics:** Real-time SpO2 (Oxygenation) + Heart Rate Variability (HRV).
* **Security Logic:** The system requires a constant "Biological Pulse." If the signal is lost or physiological anomalies are detected, the device triggers an **Instant Volatile Wipe** (<100ms) of encryption keys.

### 2. Spatial Correlation Lock (GPS + Altimeter)
Access is granted only when the smartphone and a secondary "Satellite" tracker are synchronized in physical space.
* **Barometric Sync:** If the smartphone is moved >1.0m vertically away from the tracker, the kernel locks instantly.
* **GNSS Raw Validation:** Prevents GPS spoofing by comparing raw satellite carrier-phase measurements between two independent devices.

### 3. Hardware Protocol Stripping
The SoC (System on Chip) is physically engineered to lack circuitry for legacy and high-risk protocols.
* **Stripped Protocols:** No hardware support for 2G, 3G, MMS, or Binary SMS parsing.
* **Impact:** Eliminates 95% of current "Zero-Click" transport vectors at the silicon level.
