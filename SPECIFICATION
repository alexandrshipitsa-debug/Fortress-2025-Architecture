TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION: FORTRESS-2025 ARCHITECTURE
==========================================================================
Date: December 19, 2025
Subject: Hardware-Level Protocol for Continuous Bio-Physical Authentication
Status: Technical Proposal for R&D Review
==========================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Current mobile security models are insufficient against state-sponsored APTs 
(Advanced Persistent Threats) like Pegasus. The Fortress-2025 architecture 
proposes moving the "Root of Trust" from software to an Isolated Quantum 
Enclave (IQE) governed by real-time physiological and spatial telemetry.

2. HARDWARE-LEVEL SECURITY (DATA DIODE APPROACH)

2.1. Unidirectional Bio-Telemetry (The Bio-Chip)
- Mechanism: An implantable dermal sensor measuring SpO2 and HRV.
- Hardware Constraint: Engineered as a Physical Data Diode (No RX logic).
- Security Impact: Immune to remote exploitation; immutable "Life Signaling".

2.2. Isolated Quantum Enclave (IQE)
- Architecture: Secondary processor physically decoupled from the AP.
- Function: Holds master encryption keys in Volatile Memory (SRAM).
- Failsafe: Instant Volatile Wipe (<100ms) if liveness signal is lost.

3. SPATIAL AND PROTOCOL HARDENING

3.1. Dual-Device Spatial Correlation
- Master-Satellite Link: Smartphone + dedicated Satellite tracker.
- Barometric Sync: Delta of >1m in altitude triggers kernel lock.
- GNSS Validation: Raw satellite measurement comparison to prevent spoofing.

3.2. Protocol Surface Reduction
- Hardwired Stripping: No physical circuitry for 2G/3G or binary SMS/MMS.
- Vector Mitigation: Eliminates 90% of zero-click transport methods.

4. THREAT MODEL ANALYSIS

- Zero-Click Exploit: Blocked by hardware-level protocol stripping.
- Remote Exfiltration: IQE blocks traffic without verified Liveness Signal.
- Physical Seizure: Separation of devices triggers crypto-shredding.
- Supply Chain Attack: QRNG-based unique key derivation per device.

5. CONCLUSION
The Fortress-2025 architecture binds kernel access to the user's unique 
biological and spatial presence, eliminating digital clones and stealthy 
background exfiltration.
